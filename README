Contains code to run over EDM files containing the TriggerResults object and make plots of:

- total rate w/ overlaps for a set of paths
- individual rate of paths taken by themselves
- exclusive rate of paths wrt a given set of other paths
- 2D matrix of overlaps between paths

To set up:

cmsrel CMSSW_7_4_0_patch1
cd CMSSW_7_4_0_patch1/src
cmsenv
git clone git@github.com:olivito/OverlapAnalyzer.git TrigAnalyzer/OverlapAnalyzer
scram b -j 4

Example config to run is in:

OverlapAnalyzer/test/ana_overlaps.py

This file includes the cross sections for the samples used and can also configure the luminosity to normalize to.
