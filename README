Contains code to run over EDM files containing the TriggerResults object and make plots of:

- total rate w/ overlaps for a set of paths
- individual rate of paths taken by themselves
- exclusive rate of paths wrt a given set of other paths
- 2D matrix of overlaps between paths

To set up:

cmsrel CMSSW_7_4_0_patch1
cd CMSSW_7_4_0_patch1/src
cmsenv
git clone git@github.com:olivito/OverlapAnalyzer.git TrigAnalyzer/OverlapAnalyzer
scram b -j 4

An example of merging EDM files is given in:

OverlapAnalyzer/test/merge_all.sh

An example config to run is in:

OverlapAnalyzer/test/ana_overlaps.py
OverlapAnalyzer/test/run_overlaps.sh

The .py file includes the cross sections for the samples used and can also configure the luminosity to normalize to.

After running on each sample separately, simply hadd together the output files to get the total rates, for example:

hadd rates_total.root rates_qcd_pt*.root
